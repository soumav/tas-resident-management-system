# Creating an Admin User Manually

After creating a user through Supabase Authentication (via sign up), follow these steps to manually add them to the database tables with admin privileges:

## Option 1: Using the SQL Editor in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Authentication â†’ Users
3. Find the user you just created and copy their UUID
4. Go to the SQL Editor in Supabase
5. Run the following SQL (replacing the placeholders):

```sql
-- Insert into users table with admin role
INSERT INTO users (id, email, role, created_at)
VALUES 
  ('paste-user-uuid-here', 'user-email@example.com', 'admin', NOW())
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE 
  SET role = 'admin';

-- Insert into profiles table
INSERT INTO profiles (id, name, email, created_at)
VALUES 
  ('paste-user-uuid-here', 'Admin User Name', 'user-email@example.com', NOW())
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

## Option 2: First-Time Setup - Creating an Initial Admin

If this is your first time setting up the system and you need an admin user:

1. Sign up normally through the application
2. Get the UUID from Supabase Authentication dashboard
3. Run the SQL above to set the user as admin

## Verification

To verify the user has been correctly added with admin privileges:

```sql
SELECT u.id, u.email, u.role, p.name
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.id
WHERE u.email = 'user-email@example.com';
```

The query should show the user with role 'admin' and entries in both tables.
